CSLifty
This is a barbell strength training website where you can keep track of your weights, calculate what
weights to put on the bar, and calculate different percentages of your weight (for warmups)

You can test the app at cslifty.herokuapp.com

You can test the app locally, on a local database, by running "flask run" on the command line
(while in the final project folder)
